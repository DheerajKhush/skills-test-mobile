## What I did

<!-- Describe the changes you made — bugs fixed, feature implemented. Be specific. -->

### Bug Fix 1: Excessive Re-renders
<!-- What was causing them? How did you identify it? What did you change? -->

### Bug Fix 2: Pull-to-Refresh
<!-- What was the stale state issue? How did you fix the async flow? -->

### Feature: Offline-First
<!-- How does your cache work? How do you handle the background sync → cache → update flow? -->
<!-- How did you implement the sync status indicator? -->

---

## How I approached it

<!-- Walk through your thinking. Did you start with the profiler? How did you verify re-renders were fixed? -->

---

## AI tools used

<!-- Be honest — we use AI too. We want to know HOW you use it, not whether you do. -->
<!-- Examples: "Used Cursor to scaffold the cache hook, manually rewrote the AbortController logic" -->
<!-- If you didn't use any: say so -->

---

## What I'd do differently with more time

<!-- Known limitations? Performance improvements? Edge cases you didn't handle? -->
<!-- 2-3 bullets is fine -->

---

## Testing notes

<!-- How did you test?  -->
<!-- Did you test with MOCK_FAILURE_RATE = 1? With a slow device/emulator? -->
<!-- What offline scenarios did you validate? -->
